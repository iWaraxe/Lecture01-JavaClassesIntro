### 1. **Introduction to Java Class Types** (15 minutes)

#### 1.1 **Overview of Java Class Types** (5 minutes)
In this part of the lecture, we'll start by discussing the basic building blocks of Java's type system: classes, enums, records, and interfaces. Each type plays a crucial role in Java programming and has its specific use cases and characteristics.

```java
// Regular Class Example
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;

    public Car(String make, String model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Car: " + make + " " + model);
    }
}

// Enum Example
public enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY;
}

// Record Example (Java 16+)
public record Point(int x, int y) {}

// Interface Example
public interface Drivable {
    void drive();
}
```

In the code above, we see different types of classes and their simplest forms. Regular classes encapsulate behavior and state; enums are great for fixed set of constants; records, introduced in Java 16, are perfect for immutable data carriers; and interfaces define contracts for classes.

#### 1.2 **Evolution of Java's Type System** (10 minutes)
Java's type system has evolved significantly over the versions, especially with the introduction of features like generics in Java 5, lambda expressions in Java 8, and more recently, records and sealed classes in Java 16 and 17 respectively. Let's explore these changes and understand how they impact Java programming.

```java
// Generics Example (Java 5)
public class Box<T> {
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}

// Lambda Expression Example (Java 8)
public class LambdaDemo {
    public static void executeFunctionally() {
        List<String> items = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry");
        items.forEach(item -> System.out.println(item));
    }
}

// Sealed Class Example (Java 17)
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {
    public abstract double area();
}

public final class Circle extends Shape {
    private final double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public non-sealed class Square extends Shape {
    private final double side;

    public Square(double side) {
        this.side = side;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return side * side;
    }
}
```

As we can see from these examples, Java has continuously adapted and introduced features that enhance flexibility, expressiveness, and safety in programming. Generics introduced type safety for collections, lambda expressions brought functional programming aspects, and sealed classes now provide a way to control which classes can inherit from others, a boon for more secure and maintainable code.
