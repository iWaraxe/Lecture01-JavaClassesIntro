### 4. **Records (20 minutes)**

#### 4.1 **Introduction to Records** (5 minutes)
Let's start with an introduction to records, a feature introduced in Java 14 as a preview and standardized in Java 16. Records provide a concise syntax to declare classes which are transparent holders for shallowly immutable data.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Declaration of a simple Record
public record Person(String name, int age) {}
```

**Discussion Points:**
- **Simplicity:** Records are intended to be simple data carriers, making it easier to write concise and correct data-centric classes.
- **Immutability:** All fields in a record are final by default, ensuring that the state is immutable once constructed.

#### 4.2 **Benefits of Using Records for Data-Carrying Classes** (7 minutes)
Records are especially beneficial for classes that primarily serve as data carriers. They reduce the boilerplate associated with these types of classes traditionally handled by POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects).

**Code Example:**
```java
// Traditional POJO vs. Record
// Traditional Class
public class TraditionalPerson {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    public TraditionalPerson(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        TraditionalPerson that = (TraditionalPerson) o;
        return age == that.age && Objects.equals(name, that.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "TraditionalPerson{" +
               "name='" + name + '\'' +
               ", age=" + age +
               '}';
    }
}

// Using a Record
public record PersonRecord(String name, int age) {}
```

**Live Coding**: Compare the two implementations, highlighting how the record simplifies the codebase by eliminating the need for boilerplate code like getters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

#### 4.3 **Code Demonstration: Defining and Using Records** (8 minutes)
Let’s dive deeper into how to define and use records in real-world scenarios. We'll implement a record for a practical example, such as a `Book` entity.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Defining and using a Record for a Book
public record Book(String title, String author, int year) {
    // Additional method inside the record
    public String getFormattedDetails() {
        return title + " by " + author + ", published in " + year;
    }
}

// Main method to demonstrate the use of the Book record
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Book book = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", 1949);
    System.out.println(book);
    System.out.println("Details: " + book.getFormattedDetails());
}
```

**Live Coding**: Implemented the `Book` record, showing how methods can be added to enhance functionality while enjoying record syntax’s benefits.
